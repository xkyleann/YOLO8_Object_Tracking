# YOLO8 Object Tracking 
YOLOv8 Object Tracking is a Python-based project that utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning architecture for real-time object detection and tracking in video streams. This project implements YOLOv8, an improved version of the YOLO model, which achieves high accuracy and fast inference speeds.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Object Detection:** Detects and tracks objects in real-time from video streams.

- **YOLOv8 Architecture:** Utilizes the YOLOv8 architecture, which balances accuracy and speed.

- **Easy to Use:** Simple Python interface for easy integration into existing projects.

- **Customizable:** Supports customization of detection and tracking parameters.

- **Performance:** Achieves high detection accuracy and fast inference speeds.

## Usage 
**Installation:** Clone this repository and install the required dependencies using:
```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run:** Execute the **main.py** script with the path to the video file as an argument (python main.py path/to/video/file.mp4).
   
**Visualize:** The detected and tracked objects will be displayed in a new window in real-time. 

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* OpenCV
* Ultralytics
